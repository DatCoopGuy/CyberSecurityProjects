Python Password Manager Project
	by Christian Cooper

Password manager to showcase basic Python skills and knowledge of security by using getpass and hash encryption techniques and also creating power user menu to do further actions that typical IT professionals would do in their day to day work like redoing passwords, deleting old users, and updated rosters. 



Password manager that allows user to:
Create an Account
Login to Account (admins can login and be sent to special menu with admin controls)
Exit

Admin Users can access special menu and do the following:
Check all users in database
Change Passwords of Users
Delete Users
Return to Login

Security Measures:
Checks and verifies users
Prevents changing of Admin Account
Encrypts password on command line with getpass to prevent echo packet capture
Further Encrypts passwords in hash using sha256
